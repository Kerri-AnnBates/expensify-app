# Expensify App

This simple application demonstrates the foundation for React apps. To begin, Webpack configurations was used to set up the development environment for the application.

With all the configurations set up, this app was built using a combination of react class components to manage state, and functional components to display stateless components.

Redux is used to manage the state of this application.

Simple tests are written using Jest and Enzyme for automatic testings.
